Currently pursuing the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, I am driven by a desire for ethical hacking and the critical mission of stopping cyber intrusions. Through this rigorous training, I am developing key technical competencies, including network defense, incident response, and penetration testing. My focus is on mastering the tools and techniques needed to identify vulnerabilities, mitigate risks, and secure digital assets in an increasingly complex threat landscape.

With a background in security supervision and extensive experience as a Lead Dispatcher in a fast-paced Distribution Center, I have honed my ability to manage multiple tasks, solve problems under pressure, and ensure the safety of both physical and digital assets. My work has involved coordinating driver schedules, managing yard operations, and collaborating with security teams to implement new safety policiesâ€”all skills that translate seamlessly into the cybersecurity field.

As I transition into cybersecurity, I am eager to apply my technical skills and hands-on experience in a professional setting. I am particularly interested in roles that allow me to contribute to an organization's security posture while continuing to grow and develop my expertise. My commitment to staying ahead of emerging threats drives my dedication to learning, and I am excited about the opportunity to work with forward-thinking companies that prioritize security and innovation.
